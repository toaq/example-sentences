Things to fix:

    + Dumb examples for "ra" (they work better with "ro")
    + poji -> jibo?
    + *Lack* of t4 markings (it should be marked because this is a learning material)


Last sentence: "All human beings are precious and worthwhile"



Things fixed:

    + Old cei (-> cy)
    + Old myi
    + Old lu
    + Old entire pronoun system
    + Replace "moy" with "mao"
    + Fix usages of old "mao"
    + Replace "joy" with "juaq"
    + Fix usages of old "juaq"
    + Adverbial tones
    + Tenses :(
        + Not entire sure what I meant by this, I think it was either:
            + Tenses scoping over quantifiers, which didn't turn out to be true, or
            + Tense predicates being unary again, which is now fixed (it was easy)
        + It also might have meant tenses scoping differently now, which I don't think
          is an issue among the currently-existing sentences, at least not one that
          affects enough sentences to be work fixing now in bulk
    + High adverbs in the wrong spot (right after the verb)
        + Not gonna bother fixing this in bulk as it might not even end up disallowed
    + Removed go and cu except in a few cases (fa + cu) where I didn't really know how
      to remove them
    + instances of t1 (macrons)

Things to include:

    + Numbers
    + ni
